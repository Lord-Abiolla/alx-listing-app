# ALX Listing App.

The ALX Listing App project aims to scaffold and lay the foundational structure for a modern Airbnb clone. This initial milestone focuses on setting up a well-organized and scalable codebase using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint. By establishing a clean folder structure, reusable components, and adhering to best practices, the project ensures a solid starting point for building a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly property listing page.

## Project Structure

1. __Components:__ This folder will define a reusable component that will be used across the project to display information about various properties.

2. __Interfaces:__ This will define all TypeScript interfaces related to the project.

3. __Constants:__ This sets up constants to store any reusable data or strings such as API URLs, configuration settings, or UI text

4. __Public:__ This folder holds the necessary images and SVG files that will be used across the project ensuring assets are organized for easy access.
